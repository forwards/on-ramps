## This repo will include all things associated with the Mentoring Program that R-Forwards is working on implementing.


### Some of the tasks anticipated:

* Finding an online platform to house the project. Currently looking into TAIGA, its a online project management tool.

* Designing the levels of mentorship offered:
    * Project Based
    * Hourly Based
    
* Matching Mentors with Mentees:
    * Self Match
    * Administrator Match 
    * Create a Matching Algorithm
    
* Divide Mentee into 3 levels:
    * Beginners
    * Intermediate
    * Expert
    
* Create a reward system:
    I would like to call the program R-Wings where mentors earn Bronze, Silver and Gold wings based on the hours spent and level helped. Perhaps even reward the top mentors with an award/prize
    
* Measure Success of Program
    * Wings earned
    * Surveys
    
* Funding
    * Fund the project
    * Fund the rewards/prizes
